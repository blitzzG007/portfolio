          <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
          <p>
            My name is Aly, and I am a dedicated front-end development student
            with a strong interest in UI and UX design. My journey into this
            field began in 2024, and since then, I have continued to build my
            skills through self-study, personal projects, and formal education.
          </p> <br>
          <p>
             In August, I began my studies at Nuroff, where I am developing solid
             knowledge in HTML, CSS, and user-centered design principles. I
             actively work with Figma, creating interface designs, prototypes, and
             visual layouts that focus on usability and clarity. Through this, I’ve
             learned how design decisions directly impact the development process
             and the overall user experience.
           </p> <br>
           <p>
             As part of my training, I am also gaining experience with project
             methodologies such as Agile and Kanban, as well as foundational
             project management practices. These tools help me understand how
             digital products are planned, structured, and delivered in
             professional environments.
           </p> <br>
           <p>
             I am committed to growing as both a designer and developer, with the
             long-term goal of becoming a proficient front-end developer capable of
             delivering polished, accessible, and thoughtful digital solutions.
